# juego_prueba


Due to time constraints and to fulfill the testing requirements, I opted to send this game, as despite being a bit simpler, its development is interesting. However, I'm also sending the other game that I was working on, which, as I mentioned earlier, I couldn't complete entirely due to time constraints.


The game Snake was developed, which consists of the Snake growing in size by eating food. Additionally, there are obstacles that, when consumed, make the Snake smaller and result in point deductions. The only ways to die in the game are by colliding with a wall or eating itself.

Since the files are too heavy due to the sprites, this Google Drive link was sent.
